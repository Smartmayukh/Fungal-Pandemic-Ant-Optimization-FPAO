# Fungal Pandemic Ant Optimization (FPAO) Algorithm

The Fungal Pandemic Ant Optimization (FPAO) algorithm is a metaheuristic method that uses artificial ants to explore the search space and find optimal solutions. This algorithm is inspired by the behavior of the cordyceps fungus, which infects ants and manipulates their behavior to spread and infect more hosts.

# How it Works

The FPAO algorithm works by creating a colony of artificial ants, each of which explores the search space by following pheromone trails left by other ants. Initially, the pheromone trails are random, and each ant chooses its path based on a probability that is proportional to the amount of pheromone on the path.

As the ants move through the search space, they update the pheromone trails based on the quality of the solutions they find. The amount of pheromone on a path is increased if it leads to a better solution and decreased if it leads to a worse solution.

In addition to the normal ant behavior, the FPAO algorithm introduces an additional mechanism inspired by the behavior of the cordyceps fungus. Each ant has a probability of being infected by the cordyceps fungus. If an ant is infected, it will ignore the pheromone trail and head straight towards the colony. This behavior helps the algorithm escape from local optima and find better solutions.
